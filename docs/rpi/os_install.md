# Install Raspberry Pi OS
[Raspberry Pi Imager](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/) is the quick and easy way to install Raspberry Pi OS and other operating systems to a microSD card. Watch [this short video](https://youtu.be/ntaXWS8Lk34) to learn how to install an operating system using Raspberry Pi Imager.

## Steps
- Download and install Raspberry Pi Imager to a computer with an SD card reader
- Put the SD card you'll use with your Raspberry Pi into the reader and run Raspberry Pi Imager
- Select the right OS and let the Imager download the files and create a bootable SD card

**Note:** You may want to manually download the OS in case your machine proxy/firewall won't allow the RPi Imager to download files directly.

For this purpose, browse a range of operating systems provided by Raspberry Pi from [here](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/operating-systems/), and download them to install manually. Then, point to the downloaded OS when using the RPi Imager application.
