To organize your music library in Plex so that it works better with Alexa, you can follow these steps:

Organizing Your Music Library
Folder Structure: Ensure your music is organized in a clear folder structure. A common structure is:

/Music
    /Artist Name
        /Album Name
            /01 - Track Name.mp3

Tagging: Make sure all your music files are properly tagged with metadata. This includes the artist name, album name, track title, and track number. Tools like MusicBrainz Picard or MP3Tag can help with this.

Library Settings in Plex:

Go to your Plex Web App.
Navigate to Settings > Libraries.
Select your music library and click Edit.
Ensure that the Agent is set to Plex Music and the Scanner is set to Plex Music Scanner.
Consider enabling Use embedded tags to prioritize your file tags over online metadata.
Using Alexa with Plex
Enable Plex Skill: Make sure the Plex skill is enabled in your Alexa app. You can find it by searching for "Plex" in the Alexa Skills store.

Link Your Account: Follow the instructions to link your Plex account with Alexa.

Voice Commands:

To play music by artist: "Alexa, ask Plex to play [Artist Name]."
To play a specific song: "Alexa, ask Plex to play the song [Song Name]."
To play an album: "Alexa, ask Plex to play the album [Album Name] by [Artist Name]."
