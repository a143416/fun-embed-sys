To organize your music library in Plex so that it works better with Alexa, you can follow these steps:

Organizing Your Music Library

Go to your Plex Web App.
Navigate to Settings > Libraries.
Select your music library and click Edit.
Ensure that the Agent is set to Plex Music and the Scanner is set to Plex Music Scanner.
Consider enabling Use embedded tags to prioritize your file tags over online metadata.

Robust Media Management: Plex is excellent for organizing large media libraries, offering rich metadata and a wide range of media types.
Multi-Platform Support: Works across various devices and platforms, not just Alexa.
Free Tier Available: Offers a free tier with basic functionality.
Cons:

Limited Alexa Integration: Plex's integration with Alexa is not as seamless for voice control as My Media. You might find it less intuitive to use voice commands for specific tracks or playlists.
Metadata Issues: As you've experienced, Plex can sometimes struggle with correctly identifying and organizing music metadata, which can affect playback through Alexa.
